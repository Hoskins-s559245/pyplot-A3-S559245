## Lessons Learned

Being able to use pyplot and matplotlib for different scenarios was great practice, muddling through the rigorous syntax to ensure that each axis and data point is presentable for the assignment was an invaluable task. To further my understanding of the library I made an attempt to use 3d modeling on the last question just to understand the results.
